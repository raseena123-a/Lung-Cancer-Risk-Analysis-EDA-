# Lung-Cancer-Risk-Analysis-EDA-
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a lung cancer dataset to identify key risk factors and patterns using visualizations.
## Dataset
<ahref:https://github.com/raseena123-a/Lung-Cancer-Risk-Analysis-EDA-</ahref>
## Questions Explored
1. What is the age distribution of patients?
2. Do older people have a higher chance of lung cancer?
3. Does smoking increase lung cancer risk?
4. How does alcohol consumption relate to cancer?
5.What is the cancer rate in the dataset?
##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
##  Key Insights
- Lung cancer is more frequent in older patients.
- High smoking scores are strongly associated with cancer.
- Alcohol and environmental exposure may also contribute to risk.
- ~47% of the sample were diagnosed with lung cancer.
 ## âœ… Conclusion
This EDA project provides insights into potential risk factors for lung cancer. It reveals strong associations between smoking and cancer, and opens doors for further health analytics.
